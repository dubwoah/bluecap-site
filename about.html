    <section>
      <p class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-white">We don’t chase trends.</p>
      <p class="mb-4 text-white/90">
        We work with teams building long-term value — not chasing the latest buzzword. Whether it’s enterprise AI adoption or startup execution, we help you move with clarity and purpose.
      </p>
    
      <p class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-white">We focus on what moves the needle.</p>
      <p class="mb-4 text-white/90">
        Strategy, execution, outcomes. That’s it. We support both the thinking and the doing — from roadmap design to implementation, integration, and scale.
      </p>
    
      <p class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-white">We build for the long game.</p>
      <p class="text-white/90">
        We work closely with founders, product teams, and execs — helping startups land their first enterprise customer and enterprises roll out AI where it actually works. Our partnerships are deep, focused, and built to last.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-white">PHILOSOPHY</h2>
      <p class="mb-4 text-white/90">
        We believe AI should make people more effective — not replace them. The real value comes when humans stay in the loop, and technology helps them think faster, build better, and make smarter decisions.
      </p>
      <p class="text-white/90">
        Our job is to help teams apply AI where it matters — not because it's trendy, but because it unlocks something real. That means grounding strategy in outcomes, building with intention, and always keeping people at the center of the system.

          <p class="text-sm text-white/70 mb-2">Founder, BlueCap</p>
          <p class="mb-2 text-white/90">
            Alex has spent the past 7+ years helping enterprises adopt and scale AI. As part of the founding team at HumanFirst AI, he played a central role in shaping strategy, operations, and go-to-market execution — while leading major AI transformation programs across North America, Europe, and Asia.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2 text-white/90">
            He has advised and executed on AI initiatives with clients including JPMorgan Chase, Bayer, Rakuten, Verizon, and Deloitte — as well as Quebec-based leaders like Desjardins, Videotron, and Lightspeed. His work spans both product and process: from designing enterprise-grade NLP systems to aligning cross-functional teams around adoption, enablement, and outcomes.
          </p>
          <p class="text-white/90">
            At BlueCap, Alex brings a unique mix of technical fluency, product thinking, and enterprise leadership. He’s not just a strategist — he’s a builder and operator who knows what it takes to get from idea to scaled impact. Whether you’re an enterprise team starting your AI journey or a startup building for them, he’s been in your seat — and knows how to help you move forward.
