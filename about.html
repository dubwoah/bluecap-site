      <!-- For Startups -->
      <div class="mb-8">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-2">For Startups</h3>
        <p class="text-white/90">
          We partner with technical and product-focused startup teams to help them land and scale inside the enterprise. We offer hands-on guidance around positioning, go-to-market strategy, and enterprise readiness — and we help shape the product to match real buyer needs.
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-3 text-white/90 space-y-1">
          <li>Go-to-market positioning for AI and deep-tech startups</li>
          <li>Sales and growth strategy for long-cycle, multi-stakeholder deals</li>
          <li>Enterprise integration guidance: security, compliance, deployment</li>
          <li>Founder coaching: customer calls, sales support, investor alignment</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- For Enterprise -->
      <div>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-2">For Enterprise</h3>
        <p class="text-white/90">
          We help enterprise teams adopt and scale AI initiatives with clarity and impact. From discovery to deployment, we work cross-functionally to ensure alignment, implementation, and measurable outcomes — not just slideware.
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-3 text-white/90 space-y-1">
          <li>AI strategy design: opportunity mapping, use case evaluation</li>
          <li>Pilot programs: vendor selection, internal onboarding, KPIs & metrics</li>
          <li>Org-wide alignment: workshops, cross-functional collaboration</li>
          <li>Execution support: embedded project leadership, roll-out strategy, tooling alignment</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-white">PHILOSOPHY</h2>
      <p class="mb-4 text-white/90">
        We believe AI should amplify human ability — not replace it. The best systems make people faster, smarter, and more effective — whether you're a founder building from scratch or a leader driving transformation at scale.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4 text-white/90">
        We don’t get caught up in hype. We focus on what works: strategy grounded in business outcomes, execution aligned with real constraints, and tools that actually get adopted.
      </p>
      <p class="text-white/90">
        For startups, that means building with enterprise reality in mind from day one. For enterprises, it means deploying AI where it creates durable value — not dashboards that gather dust. In both cases, our work is human-centered, outcome-driven, and built to last.

        <div class="flex-1">
          <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-white">Alex Dubois</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-white/70 mb-2">Founder, BlueCap</p>
          <p class="mb-2 text-white/90">
            Alex has spent the past 7+ years helping enterprises adopt and scale AI. As part of the founding team at HumanFirst AI, he played a central role in shaping strategy, operations, and go-to-market execution — while leading major AI transformation programs across North America, Europe, and Asia.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2 text-white/90">
            He has advised and executed on AI initiatives with clients including JPMorgan Chase, Bayer, Rakuten, Verizon, and Deloitte — as well as Quebec-based leaders like Desjardins, Videotron, and Lightspeed. His work spans both product and process: from designing enterprise-grade AI systems to aligning cross-functional teams around adoption, enablement, and outcomes.
          </p>
          <p class="text-white/90">
            At BlueCap, Alex brings a unique mix of technical fluency, product thinking, and enterprise leadership. He’s not just a strategist — he’s a builder and operator who knows what it takes to get from idea to scaled impact. Whether you’re an enterprise team starting your AI journey or a startup building for them, he’s been in your seat — and knows how to help you move forward.
