          <p class="text-sm text-white/70 mb-2">Founder, BlueCap</p>
          <p class="mb-2 text-white/90">
            Alex has spent the past 7+ years helping enterprises adopt and scale AI.

          <p class="mb-2 text-white/90">
            He has advised and executed on AI initiatives with clients including JPMorgan Chase, Bayer, Rakuten, Verizon, and Deloitte — as well as Quebec-based leaders like Desjardins, Videotron, and Lightspeed. His work spans both product and process: from designing enterprise-grade NLP systems to aligning cross-functional teams around adoption, enablement, and outcomes.
